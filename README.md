# ONVIF - Universal Standard for Security Cameras

## What is ONVIF?

If you are setting up a home or business security system, look for the ONVIF logo on cameras and NVRs (Network Video Recorders). If both devices are ONVIF-compliant, you can usually plug a Hikvision camera into a Dahua recorder, or use a Bosch camera with Milestone software, and they will work without complex custom coding.
